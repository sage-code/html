<h2>Bootstrap fundamentals</h2>
<p>When the HTML was invented all internet surfers have used desktop computers with CRT monitors to navigate.
Later the monitors become larger. Then mobile revolution has introduced smaller monitors.
Now the web-site developers have a challenge. How to design a web-site? For large or for small monitor?
The response is: "make a responsive application or web-site".
This is changing aspect depending on the screen size or browser size.</p>

<h2>Responsive design</h2>

<p>A responsive page is resizing its elements depending on the browser window size.
As an effect, when you open the website on a smaller screen, the content adapt itself for optimal view.
Some pictures may be smaller and some blocks (div) change position.
Tables can resize columns so that they all feet on the screen without lateral scrolling.
Responsive websites are very cool.</p>

<p>Bootstrap was constructed for responsive web-sites.
Once you have decided to create a responsive web-site this is already a good decision.
Next if you decide to use Bootstrap you can start your web-site with a template.
You do not have to start from scratch. Having a HTML framework or skeleton you have a productivity bust.</p>

<h2>How to use Bootstrap</h2>
<p>The secret of using Bootstrap is to get accustom with the idea that what you wish to build was already done before.
So you need to learn some user interface design. Then you need to identify the components required to reproduce that design and copy.
